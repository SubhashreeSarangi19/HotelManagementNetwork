Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive network for a hotel using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is structured to ensure efficient, secure, and reliable connectivity throughout the hotel premises.

Key Features
Routers and Switches: Configuration of routers and switches to manage traffic efficiently and ensure optimal performance.
VLANs: Implementation of Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) to segment network traffic and enhance security.
IP/MAC Addresses: Assignment of IP and MAC addresses for devices to ensure proper identification and communication within the network.
Cables: Proper cabling to connect all devices and ensure stable network connections.
DHCP: Implementation of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to assign IP addresses dynamically, reducing the need for manual configuration.
SSH: Secure Shell (SSH) protocol enabled for secure remote management and maintenance of network devices.
Network Design Components
OSPF: Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol configured for efficient and dynamic routing.

1. Routers
Configured to direct data packets between different networks.
Ensure efficient routing and connectivity.
2. Switches
Managed switches to control and direct data within the network.
VLAN configuration to separate and secure network segments.
3. VLANs
Different VLANs for different departments (e.g., Administration, Guest Wi-Fi, Security).
Enhanced security and performance by isolating network traffic.
4. IP/MAC Addressing
Static IP addresses assigned to essential devices (e.g., servers, network printers).
Dynamic IP addressing through DHCP for guest devices.
5. Cabling
Ethernet cables (Cat 5e/Cat 6) used for connecting devices.
Proper cable management to avoid interference and maintain network integrity.
6. DHCP Configuration
DHCP server configured to assign IP addresses within specified ranges.
Ensures devices can join the network automatically with minimal configuration.
7. SSH Configuration
SSH enabled on network devices for secure remote access.
Strong passwords and encryption to protect network management activities.

Implementation Steps
Planning: Outline the network requirements and design the layout.
Device Configuration: Set up routers, switches, and VLANs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
Addressing Scheme: Assign IP and MAC addresses as per the network plan.
Cabling: Connect devices using appropriate cables in Cisco Packet Tracer.
DHCP Setup: Configure DHCP on the router/switch to provide dynamic IP addresses.
SSH Setup: Enable SSH on network devices for secure management.
Testing: Test the network for connectivity, performance, and security.
Testing and Validation
Connectivity Tests: Ensure all devices can communicate within and across VLANs.
Performance Tests: Measure network speed and latency.
Security Tests: Verify SSH access and VLAN isolation.

Conclusion
The hotel network designed in Cisco Packet Tracer is structured to provide robust, efficient, and secure connectivity. The use of VLANs, DHCP, and SSH ensures optimal performance and security, making it suitable for a dynamic and high-demand environment like a hotel.
